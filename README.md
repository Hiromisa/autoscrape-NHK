# nhk-autoscrape

Using GitHub Actions and Python, this repo automatically scrapes the content of the NHK's latest news every 30 minutes
and saves it [right into the repo itself](https://github.com/Hiromisa/nhk-autoscrape/blob/main/nhk-latest20news.csv). 

All articles are written in Japanese. If you prefer other languages, please use translate function on your browser. These are links to support pages.
